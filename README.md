# Saimese Neural Network

Application of siamese neural network on small faces dataset.
The dataset is taken from here - https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/5-celebrity-faces-dataset.
The data in the dataset is reduced to ensure the model has very less images to train with (small dataset application).

The neural network is also implemented on MNIST Digit database offered by PyTorch official. This is an example for using siamese on a larger dataset.
